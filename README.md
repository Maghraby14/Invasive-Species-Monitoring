# Invasive Species Image Classification Model

## Overview
This Python notebook contains code to train a machine learning model for classifying images as either invasive species or non-invasive species. The model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and is trained on a dataset of images labeled with the presence or absence of invasive species.

Kaggle Accuracy:-  90%


## Dataset
The dataset consists of two classes: invasive species and non-invasive species. It contains images collected from various ecosystems, each labeled accordingly. The dataset is provided in a compressed format and is extracted within the notebook for preprocessing.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on the VGG16 architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. It is augmented with additional layers, including fully connected layers and dropout regularization, to enhance performance in invasive species classification.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- opencv-python
- keras

You can install these dependencies using pip:

# Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python notebook (`invasive_species_classification.ipynb`).
2. Open the notebook in a Python environment with the required dependencies installed.
3. Execute each code cell sequentially to preprocess the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for optimal performance.
5. Utilize the trained model for classifying new images of invasive species by providing the file paths to the images.
